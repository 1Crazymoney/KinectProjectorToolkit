Processing library for calibrating a kinect and a projector together, such that projector image is automatically aligned with the physical space it is projecting onto, facilitating the projection of images onto moving bodies and surfaces.

The library is new and currently under development. In the next few weeks, I will be adding documentation and tutorials.

Please see [this highlight video](https://vimeo.com/81914893) of a workshop applying the software to live dancers to see some applications of the software.

The library requires Processing 2.0+, [SimpleOpenNI](https://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/), and [OpenCV](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing).

The calibration methodology comes from this writeup by [Jan Hrdliƒçka at 3dsense blog](http://blog.3dsense.org/programming/kinect-projector-calibration-human-mapping-2/), and also uses the JAMA library for matrix math.

For other work on Projector/Kinect calibration in OpenFrameworks/vvvv, see works by Elliot Woods, Kyle McDonald, and Daito Manabe, as well as the OpenFrameworks addon ofxCamaraLucida.
